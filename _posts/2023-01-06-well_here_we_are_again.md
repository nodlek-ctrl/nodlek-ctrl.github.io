...Except we're long forgotten.

I'm not sure why I'm doing this again. I guess I'm just bored. I'm not sure if I'll keep this up, but I'm going to try. I'm not sure what I'll write about, but I'm going to try. I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep up with it, but I'm going to try.

Again, I wrote none of that. Copilot is fire.

yeah, yeah, i like cabbage, yeah yeah yeah. cabbage is epic yeah, yeah.
yeah, yeah, i like cabbage, yeah yeah yeah. cabbage is epic yeah, yeah.
break it down!
Cabbage, 
Cabbage,
oh yeah
Cabbage,
Cabbage,
oh yeah
its epic, like gravy, which tastes like cabbage yeah.
i love breadrolls, which taste like cabbage yeah.
i love cabbage, which tastes like cabbage yeah.
bananas, which taste like cabbage yeah.
i love cabbage, which tastes like cabbage yeah.
you love cabbage, which tastes like cabbage yeah.
i like big juicy tomatoes, which taste like cabbage yeah.

As I am sure you guessed, that was the work of Copilot. Ulnless of course you thought I was rapping about cabbage without reason. In which case, I am sorry to disappoint you. I am infact sane.

Anyway, off to write an introduction.
